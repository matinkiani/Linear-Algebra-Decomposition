# Linear Algebra Decomposition

This repository contains a Python script for performing LU decomposition on a given matrix. LU decomposition is a method of factorizing a matrix into a product of a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U). The script allows you to input a matrix through various methods, perform LU decomposition, and display or save the results.

## Usage

1. Run the script and choose the input mode:
    - File: Load matrix from a file.
    - Input: Manually input matrix elements.
    - Default Matrix: Use a predefined 3x3 matrix.

2. Choose the decomposition method:
    - Without Economic Storage: Decompose the matrix without optimizing storage.
    - With Economic Storage: Optimize storage during decomposition.

3. View or Save Results:
    - View the results in the terminal.
    - Save the results to an output.txt file.

## Example

```python
python lu_decomposition.py
